# JuliaGIS #

A package for the visualization and manipulation of geographic data.

## Concept ##

JuliaGIS provides a frontend for interacting with geographic data in Julia. The backend is provided by [GDAL.jl](https://github.com/wkearn/GDAL.jl) for raster data, the as-yet unwritten OGR.jl wrapper for vector data, and Images for visualization.
